There are lots of data types we’ll be using:

    - bool for a Boolean value (true or false)

    - char for a single character - always take 8 bits (1 byte) of memory

    - double for a large real number with more bits than a normal float - always take 64 bites (8 bytes)

    - float

    - int - always take 32 bits (4 bytes) of memory

    - long long for a large whole number with more bits than a normal int

    - string



Just to recap, we now know that there are a few different data types that we can use, and also print with various symbols:

    %c

    %f

    %d

    %i

    %lld

    %s
